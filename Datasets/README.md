## Data

In the Data directory are the files of the assembled var genes and an overview table of the different samples. They are part of the pf3k project - https://www.malariagen.net/projects/pf3k. The full metadata can be found here: ftp://ngs.sanger.ac.uk/production/pf3k/release_5/pf3k_release_5_metadata_20170804.txt.gz. In this directory, all raw reads are available ftp://ngs.sanger.ac.uk/production/pf3k/release_5/BAM/.

We provide the var genes of 2400 assembled genomes (we tried all more, but several samples had not enough var genes to be part of the dataset). The file formats are nucleotide (nt) and amino acids (aa) sequences (length cut-off of 1kb). To this dataset, we also provide the domains and subdomains.

From this large dataset, we generated a "normalised" dataset with 60 samples from 12 countries. From this dataset, we further provide some files like the blast comparison and some Gephi files. 

The 755 additional genomes were included in 2021.
